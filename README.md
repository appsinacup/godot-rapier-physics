-----

Godot Rapier Physics is a 2D and 3D physics drop-in replacement for the [Godot game engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) that adds stability through [rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier) and fluids through [salva](https://github.com/dimforge/salva).

# Installation

- Automatic (Recommended): Download the plugin from the official [Godot Asset Store](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2267) using the `AssetLib` tab in Godot:
    - [Rapier Physics 2D - Parallel SIMD](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2267)
    - [Rapier Physics 2D - Cross Platform Determinism](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2815)
    - [Rapier Physics 3D - Parallel SIMD](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3084)
    - [Rapier Physics 3D - Cross Platform Determinism](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3085)

- Manual: Download the [latest github release](https://github.com/appsinacup/godot-rapier-physics/releases/latest) and move only the `addons` folder into your project `addons` folder.

After installing, go to `Advanced Settings` -> `Physics` -> `2D` or `3D`. Change `Physics Engine` to `Rapier2D` or `Rapier3D`.

# Note

This plugin was recently rewritten from c++ to rust. There are still some things missing from what it had originally and may have some new bugs that it didn't have before.

The reason it was rewritten is to do easier cross platform determinism part and exports to web.

# Limitations

- SeparationRayShape2D, ConcavePolygonShape3D, HeightMapShape3D, 3D joints.
- Web exports.
- Android exports.
- Cross platform determinism.
- Double builds.
- Liquids Missing.

# Platforms

- Windows (x86_64, x86_32)
- macOS (x86-64 + arm64 Universal)
- Linux (x86_64)
- *DISABLED* Android (x86_64, arm64)
- iOS (arm64)
- *DISABLED* Web (wasm32)
